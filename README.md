# Frontend Mentor - Interactive rating component

![Design preview for the Interactive rating component coding challenge](./public/assets/design/desktop-preview.jpg/)

## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

This is a project solution for the [Interactive rating component](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/interactive-rating-component-koxpeBUmI)

I'm not a FEM pro account user so I don't have acces to the Figma design. But i still tried to develop it base on the jpeg file at the design folder.
